# TODO

Things I want:

- understanding client certificates so that I can assemble the
  necessary steps into a Makefile or a Perl script for people who want
  to limit people to editing their own spaces

- once I have client certificates working, I need to implement the
  mapping of known client certificates to wiki spaces and limit
  editing to the appropriate client certificates

- diff with previous version

- HTML output of changes

- paging through changes or simply listing all changes
