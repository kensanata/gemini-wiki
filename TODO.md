# TODO

- fix extra spaces and domains-as-spaces: wiki spaces can be
  associated with domains as spaces, perhaps? In other words, the
  space "transjovian.org/toki" means that the toki space is only
  visible from transjovian.org.

- fix All Changes

- remove pages by uploading an empty document

- HTML output of changes

- diff with previous version

- paging through changes or simply listing all changes
