# TODO

Things I want:

- different tokens for different spaces

- diff with previous version

- HTML output of changes

- paging through changes or simply listing all changes

I'm super annoyed with client certificates and by now I'm pretty sure
I hate them. I can't figure out how to connect to astrobotany using
gnutls-cli, and so it doesn't even make sense for me to try and
connect to my own server using client certificates.
