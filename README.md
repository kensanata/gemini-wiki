# Gemini Wiki

This is a Gemini wiki server. It does two things:

1. It's a program that you run on a computer and other people connect
   to it using their
   [client](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html) in order to
   read the pages on it.
   
2. It's a wiki, which means that people can edit the pages without
   needing an account. All they need is a client that speaks both
   [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) and Titan, and the
   password. The default password is "hello". ðŸ˜ƒ
