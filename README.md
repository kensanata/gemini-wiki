# Gemini Wiki

This server serves a wiki as a Gemini site.

It does two and a half things:

- It's a program that you run on a computer and other people connect to it
      using their [client](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html) in
      order to read the pages on it.
- It's a wiki, which means that people can edit the pages without needing an
      account. All they need is a client that speaks both
      [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) and Titan, and the password.
      The default password is "hello". üòÉ
- People can also access it using a regular web browser. They'll get a very
      simple, read-only version of the site.

## How do you edit a Gemini Wiki?

You need to use a Titan-enabled client.

Known clients:

- [Gemini Write](https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-write/) is an
      extension for the Emacs Gopher and Gemini client
      [Elpher](https://thelambdalab.xyz/elpher/)
- [Gemini & Titan for Bash](https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-titan/about/)
      are two shell functions that allow you to download and upload files

## What is Titan?

Titan is a companion protocol to Gemini: it allows clients to upload files to
Gemini sites, if servers allow this. On the Gemini Wiki, you can edit "raw"
pages. That is, at the bottom of a page you'll see a link to the "raw" page. If
you follow it, you'll see the page content as plain text. You can submit a
changed version of this text to the same URL using Titan. There is more
information for developers available
[on Community Wiki](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/Titan).

## Dependencies

Perl libraries you need to install if you want to run Gemini Wiki:

- [Algorithm::Diff](https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm%3A%3ADiff)
- [File::ReadBackwards](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3AReadBackwards)
- [File::Slurper](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3ASlurper)
- [Modern::Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Modern%3A%3APerl)
- [Net::Server](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AServer)
- [URI::Escape](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI%3A%3AEscape)

I'm going to be using `curl` and `openssl` in the ["Quickstart"](#quickstart) instructions,
so you'll need those tools as well.

On Debian:

    sudo apt install \
      libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl \
      libfile-readbackwards-perl \
      libfile-slurper-perl \
      libmodern-perl-perl \
      libnet-server-perl \
      liburi-escape-xs-perl \
      curl openssl

## Quickstart

Right now there aren't any releases. You just get the latest version from the
repository and that's it. I'm going to assume that you're going to create a new
user just to be safe.

    sudo adduser --disabled-login --disabled-password gemini
    sudo su gemini
    cd

Now you're in your home directory, `/home/gemini`. We're going to install
things right here. First, get the source code:

    curl --output gemini-wiki.pl \
      https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-wiki/plain/gemini-wiki.pl?h=main

Since Gemini traffic is encrypted, we need to generate a certificate and a key.
These are both stored in PEM files. To create your own copies of these files
(and you should!), use the following:

    openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem

You should have three files, now: `gemini-wiki.pl`, `cert.pem`, and
`key.pem`. That's enough to get started! Start the server:

    perl gemini-wiki.pl

This starts the server in the foreground. Open a second terminal and test it:

    echo gemini://localhost \
      | openssl s_client --quiet --connect localhost:1965 2>/dev/null

You should see a Gemini page starting with the following:

    20 text/gemini; charset=UTF-8
    Welcome to the Gemini version of this wiki.

Success!! üòÄ üöÄüöÄ

Let's create a new page using the Titan protocol, from the command line:

    echo "Welcome to the wiki!" > test.txt
    echo "Please be kind." >> test.txt
    echo "titan://localhost/raw/"`date --iso-8601=date`";mime=text/plain;size="`wc --bytes < test.txt`";token=hello" \
      | cat - test.txt | openssl s_client --quiet --connect localhost:1965 2>/dev/null

You should get a nice redirect message, with an appropriate date.

    30 gemini://localhost:1965/page/2020-06-27

You can check the page, now (replacing the appropriate date):

    echo gemini://localhost:1965/page/2020-06-27 \
      | openssl s_client --quiet --connect localhost:1965 2>/dev/null

You should get back a page that starts as follows:

    20 text/gemini; charset=UTF-8
    Welcome to the wiki!
    Please be kind.

Yay! üòÅüéâ üöÄüöÄ

Let me return to the topic of Titan-enabled clients for a moment. If you install
[Gemini & Titan for Bash](https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-titan/about/)
then you can do simple things like this:

    echo "Hello! This is a test!" | titan localhost/test hello

Or this:

    titan localhost/test hello test.txt

That makes it a lot easier to upload new content! üòÖ

## Wiki Directory

You home directory should now also contain a wiki directory called `wiki`. In
it, you'll find a few more files:

- `page` is the directory with all the page files in it
- `index` is a file containing all the files in your `page` directory for
      quick access; if you create new files in the `page` directory, you should
      delete the `index` file ‚Äì dont' worry, it will get regenerated when
      needed
- `keep` is the directory with all the old revisions of pages in it ‚Äì if
      you've only made one change, then it won't exist, yet; and if you don't
      care about the older revisions, you can delete them
- `file` is the directory with all the uploaded files in it ‚Äì if you
      haven't uploaded any files, then it won't exist, yet; you must explicitly
      allow MIME types for upload using the `--wiki_mime_type` option (see
      _Options_ below)
- `meta` is the directory with all the meta data for uploaded files in it ‚Äì
      there should be a file here for every file in the `file` directory; if
      you create new files in the `file` directory, you should create a
      matching file here
- `changes.log` is a file listing all the pages made to the wiki; if you
      make changes to the files in the `page` or `file` directory, they aren't
      going to be listed in this file and thus people will be confused by the
      changes you made ‚Äì your call (but in all fairness, if you're collaborating
      with others you probably shouldn't do this)
- `config` probably doesn't exist, yet; it is an optional file containing
      Perl code where you can mess with the code (see ["Configuration"](#configuration) below)

## Options

The Gemini Wiki has a bunch of options, and it uses [Net::Server](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AServer) in the
background, which has even more options. Let's try to focus on the options you
might want to use right away.

Here's an example:

    perl gemini-wiki.pl \
      --wiki_token=Elrond \
      --wiki_token=Thranduil \
      --wiki_pages=Welcome \
      --wiki_pages=About

And here's some documentation:

- `--wiki_token` is for the token that users editing pages have to provide;
      the default is "hello"; you can use this option multiple times and give
      different users different passwords, if you want
- `--wiki_main_page` is the page containing your header for the main page;
      that's were you would put your ASCII art header, your welcome message, and
      so on, see ["Main Page and Title"](#main-page-and-title) below
- `--wiki_pages` is an extra page to show in the main menu; you can use
      this option multiple times
- `--wiki_mime_type` is a MIME type to allow for uploads; text/plain is
      always allowed and doesn't need to be listed; you can also just list the
      type without a subtype, eg. `image` will allow all sorts of images (make
      sure random people can't use your server to exchange images ‚Äì set a
      password using `--wiki_token`)
- `--host` is the hostname to serve; the default is `localhost` ‚Äì you
      probably want to pick the name of your machine, if it is reachable from
      the Internet
- `--port` is the port to use; the default is 1965
- `--wiki_dir` is the wiki data directory to use; the default is either the
      value of the `GEMINI_WIKI_DATA_DIR` environment variable, or the "./wiki"
      subdirectory
- `--cert_file` is the certificate PEM file to use; the default is
      `cert.pem`
- `--key_file` is the private key PEM file to use; the default is
      `key.pem`
- `--log_level` is the log level to use, 0 is quiet, 1 is errors, 2 is
      warnings, 3 is info, and 4 is debug; the default is 2

## Running the Gemini Wiki as a Daemon

If you want to start the Gemini Wiki as a daemon, the following options come in
handy:

- `--setsid` makes sure the Gemini Wiki runs as a daemon in the background
- `--pid_file` is the file where the process id (pid) gets written once the
      server starts up; this is useful if you run the server in the background
      and you need to kill it
- `--log_file` is the file to write logs into; the default is to write log
      output to the standard error (stderr)
- `--user` and `--group` might come in handy if you start the Gemini Wiki
      using a different user

## Using systemd

I have no idea. Help me out?

## Security

The server uses "access tokens" to check whether people are allowed to edit
files. You could also call them "passwords", if you want. They aren't associated
with a username. You set them using the `--wiki_token` option. By default, the
only password is "hello". That's why the Titan command above contained
"token=hello". üòä

If you're going to check up on your wiki often, looking at Recent Changes on a
daily basis, you could just tell people about the token on a page of your wiki.
Spammers would at least have to read the instructions and in my experience the
hardly ever do.

You could also create a separate password for every contributor and when they
leave the project, you just remove the token from the options and restart Gemini
Wiki. They will no longer be able to edit the site.

## Privacy

The server only actively logs changes to pages. It calculates a "code" for every
contribution: it is a four digit octal code. The idea is that you could colour
every digit using one of the eight standard terminal colours and thus get little
four-coloured flags.

This allows you to make a pretty good guess about edits made by the same person,
without telling you their IP numbers.

The code is computed as follows: the IP numbers is turned into a 32bit number
using a hash function, converted to octal, and the first four digits are the
code. Thus all possible IP numbers are mapped into 8‚Å¥=4096 codes.

If you increase the log level, the server will produce more output, including
information about the connections happening, like `2020/06/29-15:35:59 CONNECT
SSL Peer: "[::1]:52730" Local: "[::1]:1965"` and the like (in this case `::1`
is my local address so that isn't too useful but it could also be your visitor's
IP numbers, in which case you will need to tell them about it using in order to
comply with the
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).

## Files

If you allow uploads of binary files, these are stored separately from the
regular pages; the wiki also doesn't keep old revisions of files around. That
also means that if somebody overwrites a file, the old revision is gone.

You definitely don't want random people uploading all sorts of images, videos
and binaries files to your server. Make sure you set up those [tokens](#security)
using `--wiki_token`!

## Main Page and Title

The main page will include ("transclude") a page of your choosing if you use the
`--wiki_main_page` option. This also sets the title of your wiki in various
places like the RSS and Atom feeds.

In order to be more flexible, the name of the main page does not get printed. If
you want it, you need to add it yourself using a header. This allows you to keep
the main page in a page called "Welcome" containing some ASCII art such that the
word "Welcome" does not show on the main page.

If you have pages with names that start with an ISO date like 2020-06-30, then
I'm assuming you want some sort of blog. In this case, up to ten of them will be
shown on your front page.

## Limited, read-only HTTP support

You can actually look at your wiki pages using a browser! But beware: these days
browser will refuse to connect to sites that have self-signed certificates.
You'll have to click buttons and make exceptions and all of that, or get your
certificate from Let's Encrypt or the like. Anyway, it works in theory. If you
went through the ["Quickstart"](#quickstart), visiting `https://localhost:1965/` should
work!

Notice that Gemini Wiki doesn't have to live behind another web server like
Apache or nginx. It's a (simple) web server, too!

Here's how you could serve the wiki both on Gemini, and the standard HTTPS port,
443:

    sudo ./gemini-wiki.pl --port=443 --port=1965 \
      --user=$(id --user --name) --group=$(id --group  --name)

We need to use `sudo` because all the ports below 1024 are priviledge ports and
that includes the standard HTTPS port. Since we don't want the server itself to
run with all those priviledges, however, I'm using the `--user` and `--group`
options to change effective and user and group ID. The `id` command is used to
get your user and your group IDs instead. If you've followed the ["Quickstart"](#quickstart)
and created a separate `gemini` user, you could simply use `--user=gemini` and
`--group=gemini` instead. üëç

## Configuration

This section describes some hooks you can use to customize your wiki using the
`config` file.

- `@extensions` is a list of additional URLs you want the wiki to handle;
      return 1 if you handle a URL
- `@main_menu` adds more lines to the main menu, possibly links that aren't
      simply links to existing pages

The following example illustrates this:

    package Gemini::Wiki;
    use Modern::Perl;
    our (@extensions, @main_menu);
    push(@main_menu, "=> gemini://localhost/do/test Test");
    push(@extensions, \&serve_test);
    sub serve_test {
      my $self = shift;
      my $url = shift;
      my $host = $self->host();
      my $port = $self->port();
      if ($url =~ m!^gemini://$host(:$port)?/do/test$!) {
        say "20 text/plain\r";
        say "Test";
        return 1;
      }
      return;
    }
    1;
