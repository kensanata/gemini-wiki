2.02

- Handle international domain names: when you provide them with the
  --host option, the address lookup happens using their punycode
  representation, and URIs containing these punycode representations
  of the international domain name are served correctly.

- Improvements to the gemini script (the simple command line client):
  knows how to stream; decodes text appropriately; has a --verbose
  flag; takes client certificates.

- Add all the extensions from the Phoebe wiki as config files for your
  conf.d directory.

- Add a gemini-chat script to work with the chat.pl config file.

- Man pages look more like man pages.

- Fixed a bug in printing the source code.

- Fixed several instances of streams not being closed correctly,
  leading to timeouts for clients that kept waiting for the end of
  file.

- Fixed the bug that config was running before the config files in
  conf.d, making it impossible to overwrite our variables.

- Changed some functions to no longer take a $stream argument.

2.00

- This is a .00 release. I expect things to break. That said, I run my
  sites with it. :)

- Change the framework underneath, from Net::Server to Mojo::IOLoop;
  this is a breaking change and you should carefully review the way
  your extensions are written!

- Phoebe no longer uses STDIN and STDOUT to serve requests but a
  Mojo::IOLoop::Stream object. Phoebe is no longer a class so the
  $self parameter of many calls either fell away or got replaced with
  a $stream object to which you $stream->write.

- Phoebe lost many options and capabilities for daemonisation. Using
  systemd is now the recommended way to run Phoebe (using a
  traditional setup is still possible, but there are no longer any
  options to set a PID file, to background the process, and so on).

- The huge config file of mine I mined for code examples got split
  into smaller files, and where you previously had one big config file
  you can now also have a conf.d/ directory with even more config
  files. All the files in the contrib/ directory of this distribution
  are lifted straight from my setup.

1.20

- Add conf.d directory next to the config file for easier code sharing
