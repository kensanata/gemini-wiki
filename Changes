2.00

- This is a .00 release. I expect things to break. That said, I run my
  sites with it. :)

- Change the framework underneath, from Net::Server to Mojo::IOLoop;
  this is a breaking change and you should carefully review the way
  your extensions are written!

- Phoebe no longer uses STDIN and STDOUT to serve requests but a
  Mojo::IOLoop::Stream object. Phoebe is no longer a class so the
  $self parameter of many calls either fell away or got replaced with
  a $stream object to which you $stream->write.

- Phoebe lost many options and capabilities for daemonisation. Using
  systemd is now the recommended way to run Phoebe (using a
  traditional setup is still possible, but there are no longer any
  options to set a PID file, to background the process, and so on).

- The huge config file of mine I mined for code examples got split
  into smaller files, and where you previously had one big config file
  you can now also have a conf.d/ directory with even more config
  files. All the files in the contrib/ directory of this distribution
  are lifted straight from my setup.

1.20

- Add conf.d directory next to the config file for easier code sharing
